# HippoLicense Toolkit

## Prerequisite

## Build and run the demo

Open the project with latest version of Android Studio.

The first screen will prompt user to enter `gCode` (user should run HippoLicense server side demo to get the gCode):

![ResultView](media/result_view.png)

User can then enter the OTP back to server side for verification.

## Integration

Copy the `MainActivity` and `ResultActivity` into your project, remember to modify `getHostInfo()` method in their common parent `BaseActivity` to get `licenseKey` and `hostId` from your target server, and get `licenseCount` from your backend system.

```Java
protected void getHostInfo() {
    // GET Host Information by e.g. scanning QR Code
    licenseKey = "LICENSE_KEY";
    hostId = "112233DDEEFF";
    // GET License Count from e.g. CRM system
    licenseCount = 12;
}
```
